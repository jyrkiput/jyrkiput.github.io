            In culture, where automation, lean, measuring and sharing are appreciated, they will happen.

          <aside class="notes">
            In first way, the emphasis is on the performance of whole system.

            The focus is in business value streams, that are enabled by IT.
            In simplest form, the stream starts when a requirement is identified,
            then passed to development and finally deployed into production.

            "From left to right"

            The outcomes of putting the First Way into
            never passing a known defect to downstream work centers,
            never allowing local optimization to create global degradation,
            always seeking to increase flow, and always seeking to achieve
            profound understanding of the system (as per Deming).

          <aside class="notes">
            In second way, feedback loops are created from downstream to upstream.
            In other words, from customers, be they internal or external
            (operations or end users) back to start of flow.

            The outcomes of the Second Way include understanding and
            responding to all customers, internal and external,
            shortening and amplifying all feedback loops, and embedding
            knowledge where we need it.

          <aside class="notes">
            The final way emphasizes culture. This culture fosters two things

            1. Continual experimentation, taking risks and learning from failure
            2. Understanding that repetition and practice is the prerequisite to mastery.

            The outcomes of the Third Way include allocating time for the improvement of daily work,
            creating rituals that reward the team for taking risks, and introducing faults into the
            system to increase resilience.
